## Introduction

If you are my classmate in programming, you will love this repository. Here, you can find several exercises in Java and Python that we have done in courses such as Object Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, Data Structures, and other subjects of the major.

The idea of sharing this repository is that I can also receive feedback and it doesn't just remain as another task in the academic aspect.
